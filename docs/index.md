# Revgrid

Welcome to the Revgrid website

Revgrid is a canvas based virtual grid focusing on realtime data display and performance. Data is injected into the grid using adapters built on schema/data interfaces.

It is a TypeScript port of [Fin Hypergrid Core](https://github.com/fin-hypergrid/core) (actually a port of the [EclipseTrading](https://github.com/EclipseTrading/hypergrid) fork of Hypergrid core). The port incorporated many of the specialised npm packages used by Hypergrid. Revgrid itself has no runtime dependencies.

To use Revgrid, you first need to create a set of adapters (implementations of the model interfaces) in order to display data with Revgrid. The test programs in the source code demonstrate how to create adapters. In addition, the Revgrid source code contains 2 pre-built adapter sets:
* **Simple**: A full data set is injected into Revgrid with a `setData()` function.
* **Record**: Allows applications to work with records and fields and converts these to rows and columns. Sorting and filtering of rows is fully handled by the adapter set. In addition, the adapter set allows recent changes in records and field values to be highlighed in the grid.

## Install Library
Revgrid is shipped via NPM. Use the following commands to install it into an application package:\
`npm i revgrid`

## Install Source
The source can be installed by cloning the repository (or a fork) at: [https://github.com/revgrid/revgrid](https://github.com/revgrid/revgrid)

To build the distribution locally, open a shell at the directory/folder in which Revgrid was cloned and run the following commands:
1. `npm install` or `npm ci` (recommended) to install required dependencies
1. `npm run dist` to generate the distribution (`dist` subfolder). This script will:
    * delete the existing `lib` and `dist` folders
    * compile the TypeScript code
    * generate the rolled up TypeScript definition files (`index.d.ts` and `revgrid-untrimmed.d.ts`)
    * generate source maps

After the distribution has been initially built, it can be rebuilt using `npm run api`. This project uses [TypeScript project references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) and the `dist` npm script forces a complete build while the `api` script only recompiles the referenced projects which have changed (so it can be a lot faster).

Note that the `lib` subfolder only holds the TypeScript declaration files generated by the compiler. Generally this subfolder can be ignored. It is used during the build process to generate the rolled up TypeScript definition files.

## Test applications

Revgrid has 2 test applications which can be easily built to see it in action:
* **testapp**: Test application for the grid.
* **recordtestapp**: Test application for the record adapter set.

Follow the steps below to build and run these applications:
1. Install the source as described above.
1. Run the respective NPM script (`testapp:serve` or `recordtestapp:serve`) to build the test application and start the server.
1. Start the application by opening the following link in your browser:
    http://localhost:3001/

Corresponding NPM scripts also exist in the package file to build the test applications but not run them.

## Building single-file bundles

UMD and ESM single file bundles can be generated for easier consumption without toolchain in-place. To do this, run `npm run bundles`, afterwards find the bundled files under `dist/bundles/`.
Bundles are not built by default and are not included in the NPM package. It is recommended to consume the library through NPM and webpack.

## More information
Currently there is no further direct information describing Revgrid.  However much of the Hypergrid documentation is relevant.  Some links are:
* [https://github.com/fin-hypergrid/core](https://github.com/fin-hypergrid/core)
* [https://fin-hypergrid.github.io/core/doc/index.html](https://fin-hypergrid.github.io/core/doc/index.html)

## Should you use Revgrid?
Revgrid is open source and used in at least one production application. However please consider the following before using it:
* There is little documentation describing covering how it works and how it should be used.
* There are significant parts of it which have not yet been tested.
* The support for it is voluntary and cannot be relied upon.
* It is specifically targetted at high performance and real time display of data (especially related to financial trading). Features not relevant to this domain will not be incorporated.

If you do intend to use it, it is recommended you have the skills to develop an understanding of the library based on the code base and existing available documentation. Also that you have sufficient development skills to be able to fix issues in the library yourself. (Pull Requests fixing issues will obviously be appreciated.)

There are many excellent alternative JavaScript grid libraries (both paid and free) to consider if the above does not align with your grid library needs and expectations.
