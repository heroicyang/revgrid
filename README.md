Revgrid is a canvas based virtual grid focusing on realtime data display and performance. Data is injected into the grid using adapters built on schema/data interfaces.

This grid is a TypeScript port of [Fin Hypergrid Core](https://github.com/fin-hypergrid/core) however with signifcant changes to the design and data model interface.

Note that it is necessary to create a set of adapters in order to display data with Revgrid. The library contains 2 pre-built adapter sets and the test programs also demonstrate how to create adapters.

## Installation
The library can be installed into an application package with the npm command:\
`npm i revgrid`
